    RULES

PLAY TEXT

Do not transcribe the play text.


Instead, leave the play text section completely blank (but still include the header).

Example:

=== PLAY TEXT ===
(blank)

start from line 157

SCHOLARLY COMMENTARY TRANSCRIPTION

Transcribe all scholarly notes exactly as printed, correcting only OCR errors (e.g., ‚Äúhaue‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúhave,‚Äù ‚Äúft‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äúst‚Äù).

No skipping, no summarizing, no omission. Every single commentary note/footnote must appear.

For each commentary note:

Use the custom line number that corresponds to the play text line (even though play text is blank).

The note must preserve the cue word/phrase with its closing bracket (e.g., word]) exactly as in the edition, with OCR errors corrected.

Format each note exactly as:

[Line#]: Scholar Name: word] Commentary text exactly as printed


Scholar‚Äôs name must always appear as printed in the edition (Capell, Johnson, Malone, Steevens, etc.).

Do not drop or alter the cue word, the bracket, or the scholar‚Äôs name.

NUMBER MATCHING REQUIREMENT

Commentary must use custom line numbers that match exactly with the numbering system of the scene.

Even though play text is blank, you must still assign continuous custom line numbers for each scene.

No double numbering, no skipped numbers.

OUTPUT FORMAT

ACT 3, SCENE 2

=== PLAY TEXT ===
(blank)

=== SCHOLARLY COMMENTARY ===
Line#: Scholar Name: word] Commentary text


VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT

At the end of the scene, verify that no commentary or footnotes are missing.

Output a summary like:

=== VERIFICATION SUMMARY ===
100% success: All scholarly commentary included with cue words, scholar names, and matching custom line numbers.

SCOPE

Apply this to ACT [3], SCENE [2].

Continue until the end of the scene.

Do not merge scenes together.

No commentary is to be omitted, cut, or summarized.

üëâ This ensures you get only scholarly commentary, fully preserved, with:

Custom line numbers

Cue words (word]) always present

Scholar names always included

No missing notes
