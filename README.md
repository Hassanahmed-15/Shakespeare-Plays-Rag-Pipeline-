# Shakespeare Plays RAG Pipeline

A small but powerful pipeline that turns messy OCR scans of Shakespeare plays into clean, line-numbered text, keeping all scholarly notes intact. Perfect for anyone who wants the Bard’s work in a **machine-friendly, research-ready format**.

## What it does
- Extracts **play lines with exact original numbers**.  
- Preserves **scholarly commentary and footnotes**.  
- Applies only tiny OCR fixes (like `ft → st` or `vpon → upon`) — nothing else.  
- Reconstructs **page breaks** to match the original edition.  

## Why it’s cool
This isn’t just text processing — it’s like giving Shakespeare a digital facelift, making his plays ready for **AI experiments, research, or just geeky exploration**. Every line, every note, perfectly respected.  

## How to use
Drop in your OCR text and let the pipeline do its thing. Out comes a **beautifully formatted, line-numbered, commentary-preserving digital edition** of the play.
